### Theory 

AC bridges are often used to measure the value of unknown impedance (self/mutual inductance of inductors or capacitance of capacitors accurately). A large number of AC bridges are available and Anderson's Bridge is an AC bridge used to measure self inductance of the coil. It is a modification of Wheatstones Bridge. It enables us to measure the inductance of a coil using capacitor and resistors and does not require repeated balancing of the bridge. The connections are shown in Fig: 1.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge is balanced by a steady current by replacing the headphone H by moving coil galvanometer and A.C source by a battery. This is done by adjusting the variable resistance, r. After a steady balance has been obtained, inductive balance is obtained by using the A.C source and headphone.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br>
The condition for balance is that the potentials at the terminals D and E are same. Then the current flowing through branch AB is I<sub>1,</sub> through branch AE and EB is I<sub>2</sub>. The current flowing through branches AD and DC is I<sub>3</sub>, while that through branch BC is I<sub>1</sub>+I<sub>2</sub>. No current flows through branch DE.</p>

#### Circuit Details
Consider the mesh ABCDA

$$I_{1}P+(I_{1}+l_{2})Q-I_{3}(jL\omega+S)-I_{3}R=0$$


$$I_{1}(P+Q)+I_{2}Q=l_{3}(S+R+jL\omega).......(1)$$

This shows that potential drop along ABC is equal to that along ADC.

Consider the mesh ABEA, there is no e.m.f.

$$I_{1}P-I_{2}r-\frac{I_{2}}{jC\omega}=0$$

$$I_{1}P-I_{2}(r-\frac{1}{jC\omega})=0............(2)$$
